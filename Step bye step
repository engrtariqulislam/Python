y = int(3)
z = float(3)

print(y)
print(z)

Get the Type
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

Single or Double Quotes?

x = "John"
print(x)
#double quotes are the same as single quotes:
x = 'John'
print(x)


Case-Sensitive
a = 4
A = "Sally"

print(a)
print(A)

myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"


print(myvar)
print(my_var)
print(_my_var)
print(myVar)
print(MYVAR)
